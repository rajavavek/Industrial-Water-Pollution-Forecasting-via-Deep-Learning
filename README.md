# Water4.0-An-Industrial-Water-Pollution-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning

Industrial water pollution is a significant environmental concern, threatening human health and ecosystems. This paper proposes Water4.0, a machine learning-based system that forecasts industrial water pollution levels using historical data and real-time monitoring. Water4.0 uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which identifies patterns and relationships based on proximity. The system considers nine water quality parameters, including pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity. Experimental results show Water4.0's impressive accuracy, outperforming traditional methods. A case study of the textile industry in Pakistan demonstrates its success in accurately predicting water pollution levels and enabling proactive measures to prevent pollution.Water4.0's significance extends beyond technical prowess, offering a proactive approach to addressing industrial water pollution. By predicting pollution levels, industries can take preventative measures, reduce their environmental impact, and ensure compliance with regulations. This helps protect aquatic ecosystems, preserve public health, and promote sustainable development. Water4.0 is a groundbreaking machine learning-based system that offers a proactive solution to industrial water pollution. By combining historical data and real-time monitoring, it can significantly impact various industries and locations.
